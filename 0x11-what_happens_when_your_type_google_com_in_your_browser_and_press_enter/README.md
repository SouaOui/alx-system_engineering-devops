Understanding the Basics

Before we dive into the intricacies of web requests and responses, it's important to have a basic understanding of how the web works. This section will provide an overview of the client-server architecture, the role of URLs, and the HTTP protocol.

The DNS Resolution

When you type "google.com" in your browser, the first step is to resolve the domain name to an IP address. This section will explain the Domain Name System (DNS) and how it translates domain names into IP addresses.

HTTP Request

After the DNS resolution, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server that hosts the website. This section will delve into the different components of an HTTP request, such as the request method, headers, and parameters.

Server-side Processing

Once the server receives the HTTP request, it processes the request and generates a response. This section will explore the server-side processing and the various technologies involved, such as server-side scripting languages and databases.

HTTP Response

The server responds to the browser's request with an HTTP response. This section will explain the different components of an HTTP response, such as the response status code, headers, and the actual content of the webpage.

Rendering the Webpage

Once the browser receives the HTTP response, it starts rendering the webpage. This section will cover the rendering process, including parsing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and rendering the final webpage on your screen.


Conclusion
Learning about the web and understanding what happens behind the scenes when you type "google.com" into your browser is a crucial step towards becoming a proficient web developer. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide and resources to help you on your web learning journey.

Happy exploring and happy coding!!!!!
